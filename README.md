I love to try things that look interesting or I never try it before. It makes me excited and motivated. 

I'm a PM, literally kind of a product manager and a project manager. But I won't care about the title, I know I just a  'designer' that solves a problem through design. It makes me excited when I know what I do can help to other people.

My goal is to be a renaissance girl, I know it's hard and there is a long way along with. 
- "Be patient, step by step. You can be a slow walker, but you can't walk back. "
- " Never stop, keep exploring. Smile to the world with my gratitude."

### And...Me?
- 🥛 I drink a bottle of milk tea every day without ice and sugar, but pearls.
- 🤯 I think I got a little bit of ' generalized anxiety disorder '. I'm sorry about that sometimes I look like depression😵, just leave me alone. I can address it by myself.
- 🗺 I won't stay at home during my weekend, I love to explore cafe & restaurant ...  Find a cozy spot in a city make me relax.🤟
- 🤡 Sometimes I will get messy on my speaking🙇‍, believe me, I will train harder to organize my communication. 
- 📸 I love to record my life and share my opinion of the world. But I seldom shoot video recently due to didn't have time ...
- 📝 Although I get used to writing stuff in a big moment, it quite depends on my mood. 
- 💃🏾 I have been studying Hip Hop for around three months. As a freshman, and apparently have no talent of dancing, but I still enjoy shaking my body ~ just keep moving ~~
- 🥯 Seriously, I think I'm a bagel lover🥯, I have tasted most of the bagel in shanghai. Mexico food is quite fit for my taste, especially burrito🌯 and taco🌮 ~~~ 

### What am I learning currently?
I'm trying to learn about programming, because *I wanna build my ideas and make it happen.*
I  will put my attention to the front-end at first :)
