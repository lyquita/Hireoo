I love to try things that look interesting or never try before. It makes me excited and motivated. 

### And...Me?
- 🥛 I drink a bottle of milk tea every day without ice and sugar, but pearls.
- 🤯 I think a got a little bit of ' generalized anxiety disorder '. I'm sorry about that sometimes I look like depression😵, just leave me alone. I can address it by myself.
- 🗺 I won't stay at home during my weekend, I love to explore cafe & restaurant ...  Find a cozy spot in a city make me relax.🤟
- 🤡 Sometimes I will get messy on my speaking🙇‍, believe me, I will train harder to organize my communication. 
- 📸 I love to record my life and share my opinion of the world. But I seldom shoot video recently due to didn't have time ...
- 📝 Although I get used to writing stuff in a big moment, it quite depends on my mood. 
- 💃🏾 I have been studying Hip Hop for around three months. As a freshman, and apparently have no talent of dancing, but I still enjoy shaking my body ~ just keep moving ~~
- 🥯 Seriously, I think I'm a bagel lover🥯, I have tasted most of the bagel in shanghai. Mexico food is quite fit for my taste, especially burrito🌯 and taco🌮 ~~~
